## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned
 I learned a lot about using display: hidden v.s display: none. How to make error
 text show up without causing other elements to "jump". I also learned about
 form validation using state.

### Continued development
I really want to make the backend for this site. Use a database to 
store all the inputs, figure out how to validate on the server.


### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great site for looking up all the info you need!
- (https://validator.w3.org/) - Always test your sites!!
